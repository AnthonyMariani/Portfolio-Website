          <h1>Hi there! I'm Anthony</h1>
          <p>
            I am a senior at Miami University majoring in Economics with a minor
            in Computer Science. My educational journey has equipped me with a
            unique blend of analytical insight and technical expertise. This
            combination empowers me to tackle challenges with both strategic
            thinking and practical application, making me well-suited for roles
            where innovation and data-driven decision-making are key.
          </p>

          <p>
            Throughout my college career, I've found joy in deciphering complex
            data, leading me to build statistical applications and engage in
            data visualization for both academic and personal projects. My
            proficiency in SQL and database management, crucial for data
            analytics, is complemented by my skill in R for statistical
            modeling, enhancing my ability to analyze and interpret data
            effectively. This, combined with my web development background,
            gives me a comprehensive understanding of the digital landscape and
            data management.
          </p>
          <p>
            With an entrepreneurial mindset, I am eager to contribute to
            environments where my skills can foster impactful solutions and
            drive progress. I'm excited to explore opportunities that align with
            my passion for data and technology, where I can continue to grow and
            make meaningful contributions.

            As for the functionality, we have the Player Search tab that allows
            users to search stats by player, which will show them individual
            game statistics and season statistics. The All Players tab allows
            users to filter the database by position in order to find players.
            Third, we have the Leaderboards tab that allows users to filter the
            database by nearly any metric, showing the leaders in each
            respective statistic. Finally, we have the Fantasy tab that allows

            applications that not only process data efficiently but also present
            it in a manner that enriches user experience and decision-making.
            It's a clear indicator of my capability to handle and visualize
            data, underscoring my passion for technology, data analysis, and
